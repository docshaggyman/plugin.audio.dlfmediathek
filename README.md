# DLF Mediathek KODI Plugin

This is a simple plugin for KODI mediacenter (https://kodi.tv/) to enable access to the online media library of the German radio station Deutschlandfunk (DLF), including "DLF Nova" and "DLF Kultur".

The plugin is currently in early alpha state, so I will not provide any installation instructions yet.
If you know what you are doing, please feel free to install it manually and give it a shot. Any comments are welcome.

Once the plugin is in a stable state, I plan to submit it to the Kodi repo.
